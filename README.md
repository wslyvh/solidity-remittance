# solidity-remittance

You will create a smart contract named Remittance whereby:

There are three people: Alice, Bob & Carol.
Alice wants to send funds to Bob, but she only has ether & Bob wants to be paid in local currency.
Luckily, Carol runs an exchange shop that converts ether to local currency.
Therefore, to get the funds to Bob, Alice will allow the funds to be transferred through Carol's Exchange Shop. Carol will convert the ether from Alice into local currency for Bob (possibly minus commission).

To successfully withdraw the ether from Alice, Carol needs to submit two passwords to Alice's Remittance contract: one password that Alice gave to Carol in an email and another password that Alice sent to Bob over SMS. Since they each have only half of the puzzle, Bob & Carol need to meet in person so they can supply both passwords to the contract. This is a security measure. It may help to understand this use-case as similar to a 2-factor authentication.

Once Carol & Bob meet and Bob gives Carol his password from Alice, Carol can submit both passwords to Alice's remittance contract. If the passwords are correct, the contract will release the ether to Carol who will then convert it into local funds and give those to Bob (again, possibly minus commission).

Of course, for safety, no one should send their passwords to the blockchain in the clear.

## Stretch goals:

* add a deadline, after which Alice can claim back the unchallenged Ether
* add a limit to how far in the future the deadline can be
* add a kill switch to the whole contract
* plug a security hole (which one?) by changing one password to the recipient's address
* make the contract a utility that can be used by David, Emma and anybody with an address
* make you, the owner of the contract, take a cut of the Ethers smaller than what it would cost Alice to deploy the same contract herself
